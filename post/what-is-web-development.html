            <p><strong>Web development is a process which consists of many phases of effort involving the planning, creation, and maintenance of websites.</strong></p>

            <p>It can involve various disciplines, from graphic design and database development to content writing and web design.</p>

            <p>Web development also refers to the practice of converting a business' various marketing and sales materials into a format that can be published on the web.</p>

            <p>A broad spectrum of web development skills are required by today's businesses.</p>

            <p>With the advancement of technology, there is certainly no shortage of content creators who have the skills to write compelling articles, but are not equipped with the technical skills to build a website.</p>

            <p>Articles on your website can attract new customers but if you aren’t using clean and neat code, then your website might as well be junk.</p>

            <p>The question is not whether you need it - but what is it? Web development is not just making your site up-to-date. Here's what you get:</p>
