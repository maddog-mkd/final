            <p><strong>Search Engine Optimization or SEO. SEO is the process of optimizing your website in order to achieve higher rankings on search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. The goal of SEO is to grow traffic to your website through natural organic means like indexing by search engines rather than paying for advertising on a search engine. SEO is a long-term process that begins at the beginning of a site's lifetime.</strong></p>

            <p>Before going into how to do SEO let's talk about what it is. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which means that your website is improving its search rankings through the use of internet marketing practices, tools and techniques.</p>

            <p>A way to think about this topic is that your site has been put into a competitive market (the search task) and your job as an organization or individual is to create value by winning over searcher's minds sf they are searching for something on a particular topic or thing.</p>

            <p>SEO can be done manually by doing things such as re-writing your content, writing better headlines, creating video, and so on. But there are a ton of tools out there that make SEO much easier.</p>

            <p>SEO helps to raise your website's ranking on search engines. It does this by ensuring that the site is easy to crawl and load quickly (e.g., no low-quality images or code), and that it contains specific text known to be positively correlated with high rankings, like focused keywords.</p>

            <p>It also means making sure links are pointing to your site from other sites and platforms such as Wikipedia or Twitter — this is called "backlinks. "SEO" is also a broader term that encompasses link-building, keyword research and content creation.</p>
